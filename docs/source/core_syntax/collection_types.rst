Collection Types
================
These types store a collection of primitive types, objects, and even collection types!

``NumpyArray``
--------------
This type is the same as the Numpy ``ndarray()`` class. This is built in and every object in the array is separated by commas. All of that is around a pair of brackets.

.. code-block:: neutron

  (1, 2, 3, 4, 5);  // Evaluates to Numpy Array

``ListType``
------------
This type is the same as the Python list class. This is built in and every object in the list is separated by commas. All of that is around a pair of square brackets.

.. code-block:: neutron

  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];  // Evaluates to python list

``TupleType``
-------------
This type is the same as the Python tuple class. This is built in and every object in the tuple is separated by commas. All of that is around a pair of curly brackets.

.. code-block:: neutron

  {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};  // Evaluates to python tuple
