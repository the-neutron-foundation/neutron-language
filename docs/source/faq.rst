Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

**Is the Neutron language compiled python (e.g. pyinstaller) or interpreted python?**
**BOTH!!** The releases are the executable format, but the source is in Python. This means that you can run Neutron using the ``python3`` command OR use the executable file. We use `Nuitka <https://nuitka.net/pages/overview.html>`_ to convert the python code into an executable.

**Why Should I use Neutron?**
The main reason is because it has more features (even more coming soon) than python 3, including Numpy Arrays built-in, and because it is extremely configurable.
