Utils Package
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This package is responsible for all the functions that have to do with list, tuples, and Numpy arrays.

``utils/len``
=============
``len(obj)`` gets the length (total number of items) of a list, tuple, or Numpy array (passed as the ``obj`` argument) and returns it as a ``IntType``, given an argument.

``utils/range``
===============
``range(start, end)`` returns a ``ListType`` ranging from two arguments (``start``, ``end``) similar to that of python (the ``range()`` function in python but it takes 2 arguments)
